We start with a crash course on statistical data analysis by [fitting a line to data](Fitting-a-line.ipynb), have a [brief look at `astropy`](Astropy-Demo.ipynb) for its use of physical units and coordinates, and then bring it all together by reproducing the work of Edwin Hubble and estimating the [expansion velocity of the universe](Hubble.ipynb).
