    "   I will not give any more requirements to how you structure this exercise.\n",

    "* Do this estimate using 100, 1000, 10,000, and 1e6 points.\n",
    "* How long does the calculation take for different numbers of points?  Make a figure that illustrates how the calculation time depends on the number of points.      \n",
    "* Make a figure that displays the \"darts.\"\n",
    "* Run this calculation many times for a single `N` (number of darts), and plot a histogram of the results.  What is the mean and standard deviation of these estimates?\n",
    "* Make a plot that illustrates the precision of the pi estimate as a function of number of random points used.\n",

    "Make a notebook that demonstrates how your `pi_estimate` module works, as\n",
    "    well as presenting the results of all your calculations.  The notebook\n",
    "    should have minimal complicated code in it; rather, it should initialize\n",
    "    objects and call functions defined within the `pi_estimate` module.\n"
