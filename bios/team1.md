This is the team bio for Sinclaire and Tori:

Sinclaire:
I am a sophomore at Princeton University from Northern Virginia. I hope to major in astrophysics. I am a member of the Princeton Highsteppers and I like watching soccer and stargazing in my free time. 


Tori:

I am a rising sophomore at Princeton University from Chicago, Illinois. I am currently undeclared, but deciding between a physics and astrophysics major, seeing as my two interests currently are cosmology and biophysics. Outside of physics, I am a dancer on Bodyhype Dance company. Thus, I enjoy dancing, along with drawing, reading/writing, and playing with my dog and cat. I'm very excited to work with the astrophysics department this summer, and to learn a lot more about coding and data analysis.
