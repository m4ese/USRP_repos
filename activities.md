# Activities in Princeton

This is a list of ideas for activities in Princeton over the course of the summer for you to enjoy.
It's a small list at the moment based on the few ideas that popped in my mind and based on Polly's recommandations. All of these spots are within walking distance from the campus. 
Feel free to update it if you have more ideas or discover new interesting stuffs that you would like to share with the group.

A bunch of ideas:

* Princeton [garden theatre](https://princetongardentheatre.org/) is a non-profit community-based theatre that has a very interesting selection of, mostly independent and sometimes foreign movies. The have prices for students, making it very affordable. During the summer they also propose a selection of classic movies from different eras.

* Princeton [art museum](https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/). The museum of the University, although seamingly small has a fascinating collection of archeological artifacts from various civilisations across the globe as well as a impressive painting collection and a rotatting selection of modern art. Admission is free, and there is honestly a lot of time to spend there!

* [Princeton summer theater](http://www.princetonsummertheater.org/). I have not had a chance to go there myself yet, but this season will start on June 20th with a great selection of plays. I think someone in the program might be able to answer more questions about theatre than I ;)

* [Princeton tours](https://princetontourcompany.com/activities/category/walking-tours/). It is possible to take various tours to enjoy some of the famous and interesting places in Princeton.

* [Institute's woods](https://goo.gl/maps/nuksz1E3RKt7rixP6). Located near the institute for advanced studies, the institute woods is a great place to take a walkl and breath after work or over the week end. 

* The [Dylon gym](https://campusrec.princeton.edu/facilities-operations/locations/dillon-gym) is a great place to exercise or practice your favourite sports.

* Dining and going out. Princeton down town has a fairly large selection of shops, restaurants, cafes, ice cream shops, etc... Most of them are located along Nassau street, witherspoon street and Palmer square.
